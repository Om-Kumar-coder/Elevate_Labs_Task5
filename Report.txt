Protocols I identified (3+)

From the capture screenshots I can clearly see at least these protocols:

1. TCP — many flows (SYN packets, ACKs, retransmissions). Example: Frame 8 shows 10.69.195.150 -> 34.36.137.203, src port 55076 -> dst port 443 (SYN) indicating an HTTPS handshake attempt.


2. UDP — DNS and NTP run over UDP in the trace. Example: Frame 7 (screenshot) shows a DNS response src port 53 -> dst ephemeral port 54738 from 10.69.195.52 to 10.69.195.150. NTP packets are also visible in the UDP listing.


3. TLS (TLSv1.2) — TLS Client Hello / Server records are visible (SNI contile.services.mozilla.com) over TCP/443.


4. QUIC — QUIC Initial/Handshake frames are visible (QUIC runs over UDP and is used for HTTP/3).


5. OCSP — OCSP Request/Response messages appear (certificate status checks).
(So at minimum: TCP, UDP and application-layer TLS/QUIC — plus DNS, OCSP, NTP as application protocols.)

Summary of key packet details (from screenshots)

Frame 8 (TCP SYN to HTTPS)
Src IP: 10.69.195.150 → Dst IP: 34.36.137.203
Src Port: 55076 → Dst Port: 443
Flags: [SYN] — beginning of TLS handshake.

TLS Client Hello
TLSv1.2 Client Hello present; SNI contains contile.services.mozilla.com. TLS record size appears in capture and Wireshark decodes it.

Frame 65 (TCP SYN to port 80)
Src IP: 10.69.195.150 → Dst IP: 142.250.182.35
Src Port: 37410 → Dst Port: 80
Flags: [SYN] — HTTP connection attempt (port 80). OCSP and other HTTP interactions are shown nearby.

Frame 7 (DNS response UDP)
Src IP: 10.69.195.52 (port 53) → Dst IP: 10.69.195.150 (ephemeral port 54738)
DNS AAAA/ A responses include contile.services.mozilla.com and other names.

QUIC Handshake packets
Several QUIC Initial/Handshake packets between 34.36.137.203 and 10.69.195.150 are visible — likely HTTP/3 traffic.
