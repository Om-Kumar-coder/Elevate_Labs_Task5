Run tshark -r wireshark.pcap -q -z conv,ip to enumerate top IP conversations.

Export specific flows (by IP and port) to separate PCAPs and analyze RTT, retransmissions and throughput.

If you have the browser SSLKEYLOGFILE keys, load them into Wireshark to decrypt TLS; for QUIC/HTTP3 decryption is more involved.

Correlate retransmissions/dup ACKs with capture host performance or intermediate device behavior.
